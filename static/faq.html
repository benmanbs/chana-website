    <h1 class="center">FAQs</h1>
    <em><strong>Q: What does a 1-on-1 session in Songbird.Studio look like?</strong></em>
    <p/>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        A: In our sessions we will work on the specific sounds that YOU wish to learn. Because of this,
        I ask that you bring in a song or a phrase that you’d like to work on and we will start from
        there to establish your goals and figure out the best and quickest way of getting you there.
        Through logic, explanation, sensations, images, and auditive examples we will figure out your
        personal preference of how to learn and achieve your goals in an accepting and facilitating
        atmosphere. I’m a pretty goofy instructor so you have lots of fun to look forward to as well!
    </div>
    <p/><br/>
    <em><strong>Q: Do I need to be talented to learn how to sing?</strong></em>
    <p/>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        A: Nope! Great thing about music and singing is that it’s just like any other learned skill -
        you just need to establish muscle memory by practicing good technique! Of course, each songbird
        has their own learning style and learning pace, but overall roughly 97-98% of the population can
        learn how to master their instrument. All you gotta do is start somewhere!
    </div>
    <p/><br/>
    <em><strong>Q: Can you repair vocal damage?</strong></em>
    <p/>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        A: This depends. If you have a chronically hoarse voice, please see a laryngologist (and ENT
        doctor who specializes in the vocal cords) and ask them if you’re able to start singing lessons.
        If the doctor gives you the OK then we can definitely work on repairing what is probably incorrect
        muscle memory of the voice. I have helped singers with raspy voices, speech impediments, and
        partially paralyzed cords regain the steady, clear, dynamic, and powerful sound they once had. All
        it takes is patience and practice!
    </div>
    <p/><br/>
    <em><strong>Q: Do I need to have knowledge of singing technique before scheduling my first session?</strong></em>
    <p/>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        A: Nope! Just bring your voice, a song, and some good energy, and I’ll take care of the rest!
    </div>
    <p/><br/>
    <em><strong>Q: I’d like to sing all the powerful rock high notes and rough vocal effects, but I have been
        told they’re dangerous and can destroy the vocal folds. Is this true?</strong></em>
    <p/>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        A: No sound is dangerous in and of itself. That being said, lack of technique with even the quietest
        sounds can damage the vocal folds. CVT (Complete Vocal Technique) is one of the methods that I teach
        and it specializes in teaching these sounds and effects in a healthy and sustainable way. Babies have
        been known to growl, distort the sound, and scream since their first moments on earth, and they NEVER
        get hoarse. Just saying.
