            <h1>Welcome to Songbird.Studio!</h1>
            I’m Grace, and I have been the proud teacher of songbirds all over the world for
            over a decade. Teaching singing and getting my singers to realize their vocal
            ambitions is what inspires me most. I always look forward to that look on your
            face during our sessions when songbirds will say: <em>“Oh my god, I can’t believe
            I sang that note!”</em> or <em>“I never thought it would be so easy!”</em> - Your
            success is my success and I love working <em><strong>with</strong></em> you to
            find the sound <em><strong>you</strong></em> want.
            <p/>
            I teach singers of all levels, ages, and genres. From round classical sounds, to
            hard rock distortion, to gospel growls, and country vocal breaks - all sounds are
            created equal in our studio and can be produced in a healthy way. When you’re in
            my studio - ain’t no such thing as ‘Can’t’. We will tackle all challenges with
            good times and laughter. After all, we say “play” music and not “work miserably
            hard” at music. Let’s play :)
            <p/>
            I have over a decade of experience in teaching voice and I also have plenty of
            experience with vocal damage repair, improving speech impediments with vocal
            technique principles, and the like. I am currently a CVT (Complete Vocal Technique)
            teacher-in-training at Complete Vocal Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark. This method
            is designed to do what I love best - getting fast results, and using concrete tools
            that have been backed by published scientific research. Before enrolling in the
            teacher’s course I would coach my songbirds by using a mixture of traditional
            methods and modern scientific techniques that also produced fast and thorough
            results, and I even had a two year stint at a music conservatory program studying
            vocal performance in Jazz and Contemporary Music, before moving to NYC to record my
            first original album.
            <p/>
            In conclusion: Whether you’re looking for better singing technique or for artistic
            development coaching - I’m down to get your singing journey on the fast track!
